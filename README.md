Welcome to HDLBits!

Getting started in digital logic design can be overwhelming at first because you need to learn new concepts, a new Hardware Description Language (e.g., Verilog), several new software packages, and often an FPGA board, all at the same time. HDLBits provides a way to practice designing and debugging simple circuits with a single click of "Simulate".

Designing a circuit requires several steps: Writing HDL (Verilog) code, compiling the code to produce a circuit, then simulating the circuit and fixing bugs.

Writing Code

The easiest way to write your code is to do so in the code editor box below. For this problem, we have filled in most of the code for you already. Go ahead and finish the code for this circuit.

Click Simulate to compile and simulate your design.
Compiling (Logic Synthesis)

Your code is compiled using Altera Quartus to produce a circuit. Quartus produces a large number of messages. Click Show Quartus messages to show/hide them. It's good practice to reduce the number of warnings, but it is sometimes not practical to remove them all.
Simulation

Your compiled circuit is simulated to test whether it functions correctly. HDLBits use ModelSim to simulate your circuit and our reference solution in parallel, then compares the outputs of the modules. The simulation reports back two things:

First, it reports whether your circuit matches the reference circuit exactly (zero "mismatches") or how many "mismatches" occurred. A mismatch is the number of samples where the output of your circuit does not match the reference output.

Second, it may produce timing diagrams that show your circuit outputs when running our test vectors. The simulation waveform is grouped into three sections: "Inputs", "Yours", and "Ref". In a correct circuit, "Your" outputs will be the same as the "Ref" outputs. The "Mismatch" signals tells you which samples have a mismatch.

Problem Statement

We're going to start with a small bit of HDL to get familiar with the interface used by HDLBits. Here's the description of the circuit you need to build for this exercise:
###########################################################################
Step one
###########################################################################
Build a circuit with no inputs and one output. That output should always drive 1 (or logic high).


###########################################################################
Zero
###########################################################################
Build a circuit with no inputs and one output that outputs a constant 0

Now that you've worked through the previous problem, let's see if you can do a simple problem without the hints.

###########################################################################
Wire
###########################################################################
Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire.

Unlike physical wires, wires (and other signals) in Verilog are directional. This means information flows in only one direction, from (usually one) source to the sinks (The source is also often called a driver that drives a value onto a wire). In a Verilog "continuous assignment" (assign left_side = right_side;), the value of the signal on the right side is driven onto the wire on the left side. The assignment is "continuous" because the assignment continues all the time even if the right side's value changes. A continuous assignment is not a one-time event.

The ports on a module also have a direction (usually input or output). An input port is driven by something from outside the module, while an output port drives something outside. When viewed from inside the module, an input port is a driver or source, while an output port is a sink.

The diagram below illustrates how each part of the circuit corresponds to each bit of Verilog code. The module and port declarations create the black portions of the circuit. Your task is to create a wire (in green) by adding an assign statement to connect in to out. The parts outside the box are not your concern, but you should know that your circuit is tested by connecting signals from our test harness to the ports on your top_module.

###########################################################################
Wire4
###########################################################################
Create a module with 3 inputs and 4 outputs that behaves like wires that makes these connections:

a -> w
b -> x
b -> y
c -> z

The diagram below illustrates how each part of the circuit corresponds to each bit of Verilog code. From outside the module, there are three input ports and four output ports.

When you have multiple assign statements, the order in which they appear in the code does not matter. Unlike a programming language, assign statements ("continuous assignments") describe connections between things, not the action of copying a value from one thing to another.

One potential source of confusion that should perhaps be clarified now: The green arrows here represent connections between wires, but are not wires in themselves. The module itself already has 7 wires declared (named a, b, c, w, x, y, and z). This is because input and output declarations actually declare a wire unless otherwise specified. Writing input wire a is the same as input a. Thus, the assign statements are not creating wires, they are creating the connections between the 7 wires that already exist.

###########################################################################
Notgate
###########################################################################
Create a module that implements a NOT gate.

This circuit is similar to wire, but with a slight difference. When making the connection from the wire in to the wire out we're going to implement an inverter (or "NOT-gate") instead of a plain wire.

Use an assign statement. The assign statement will continuously drive the inverse of in onto wire out.

###########################################################################
Andgate
###########################################################################
Create a module that implements an AND gate.

This circuit now has three wires (a, b, and out). Wires a and b already have values driven onto them by the input ports. But wire out currently is not driven by anything. Write an assign statement that drives out with the AND of signals a and b.

Note that this circuit is very similar to thie NOT gate, just with one more input. If it sounds different, it's because I've started describing signals as being driven (has a known value determined by something attached to it) or not driven by something. Input wires are driven by something outside the module. assign statements will drive a logic level onto a wire. As you might expect, a wire cannot have more than one driver (what is its logic level if there is?), and a wire that has no drivers will have an undefined value (often treated as 0 when synthesizing hardware).

###########################################################################
Norgate
###########################################################################
Create a module that implements a NOR gate. A NOR gate is an OR gate with its output inverted. A NOR function needs two operators when written in Verilog.

An assign statement drives a wire (or "net", as it's more formally called) with a value. This value can be as complex a function as you want, as long as it's a combinational (i.e., memory-less, with no hidden state) function. An assign statement is a continuous assignment because the output is "recomputed" whenever any of its inputs change, forever, much like a simple logic gate.

###########################################################################
Xnorgate
###########################################################################
Create a module that implements an XNOR gate.

###########################################################################
Wire decl
###########################################################################
Declaring wires

The circuits so far have been simple enough that the outputs are simple functions of the inputs. As circuits become more complex, you will need wires to connect internal components together. When you need to use a wire, you should declare it in the body of the module, somewhere before it is first used. (In the future, you will encounter more types of signals and variables that are also declared the same way, but for now, we'll start with a signal of type wire).


module top_module (
    input in,              // Declare an input wire named "in"
    output out             // Declare an output wire named "out"
);

    wire not_in;           // Declare a wire named "not_in"

    assign out = ~not_in;  // Assign a value to out (create a NOT gate).
    assign not_in = ~in;   // Assign a value to not_in (create another NOT gate).

endmodule   // End of module "top_module"

In the above module, there are three wires (in, out, and not_in), two of which are already declared as part of the module's input and output ports (This is why you didn't need to declare any wires in the earlier exercises). The wire not_in needs to be declared inside the module. It is not visible from outside the module. Then, two NOT gates are created using two assign statements. Note that it doesn't matter which of the NOT gates you create first: You still end up with the same circuit.
Practice

Implement the following circuit. Create two intermediate wires (named anything you want) to connect the AND and OR gates together. Note that the wire that feeds the NOT gate is really wire out, so you do not necessarily need to declare a third wire here. Notice how wires are driven by exactly one source (output of a gate), but can feed multiple inputs.

If you're following the circuit structure in the diagram, you should end up with four assign statements, as there are four signals that need a value assigned.

###########################################################################
7458
###########################################################################
The 7458 is a chip with four AND gates and two OR gates. This problem is slightly more complex than 7420.

Create a module with the same functionality as the 7458 chip. It has 10 inputs and 2 outputs. You may choose to use an assign statement to drive each of the output wires, or you may choose to declare (four) wires for use as intermediate signals, where each internal wire is driven by the output of one of the AND gates. For extra practice, try it both ways.

###########################################################################
Vector0
###########################################################################
Vectors are used to group related signals using one name to make it more convenient to manipulate. For example, wire [7:0] w; declares an 8-bit vector named w that is functionally equivalent to having 8 separate wires.

Notice that the declaration of a vector places the dimensions before the name of the vector, which is unusual compared to C syntax. However, the part select has the dimensions after the vector name as you would expect.


wire [99:0] my_vector;      // Declare a 100-element vector
assign out = my_vector[10]; // Part-select one bit out of the vector

Build a circuit that has one 3-bit input, then outputs the same vector, and also splits it into three separate 1-bit outputs. Connect output o0 to the input vector's position 0, o1 to position 1, etc.

In a diagram, a tick mark with a number next to it indicates the width of the vector (or "bus"), rather than drawing a separate line for each bit in the vector.

###########################################################################
Vector1

Vectors are used to group related signals using one name to make it more convenient to manipulate. For example, wire [7:0] w; declares an 8-bit vector named w that is equivalent to having 8 separate wires.

    2 Accessing Vector Elements: Part-Select
    3 A Bit of Practice

Declaring Vectors

Vectors must be declared:

type [upper:lower] vector_name;

type specifies the datatype of the vector. This is usually wire or reg. If you are declaring a input or output port, the type can additionally include the port type (e.g., input or output) as well. Some examples:

wire [7:0] w;         // 8-bit wire
reg  [4:1] x;         // 4-bit reg
output reg [0:0] y;   // 1-bit reg that is also an output port (this is still a vector)
input wire [3:-2] z;  // 6-bit wire input (negative ranges are allowed)
output [3:0] a;       // 4-bit output wire. Type is 'wire' unless specified otherwise.
wire [0:7] b;         // 8-bit wire where b[0] is the most-significant bit.

The endianness (or, informally, "direction") of a vector is whether the the least significant bit has a lower index (little-endian, e.g., [3:0]) or a higher index (big-endian, e.g., [0:3]). In Verilog, once a vector is declared with a particular endianness, it must always be used the same way. e.g., writing vec[0:3] when vec is declared wire [3:0] vec; is illegal. Being consistent with endianness is good practice, as weird bugs occur if vectors of different endianness are assigned or used together.
Implicit nets

Implicit nets are often a source of hard-to-detect bugs. In Verilog, net-type signals can be implicitly created by an assign statement or by attaching something undeclared to a module port. Implicit nets are always one-bit wires and causes bugs if you had intended to use a vector. Disabling creation of implicit nets can be done using the `default_nettype none directive.

wire [2:0] a, c;   // Two vectors
assign a = 3'b101;  // a = 101
assign b = a;       // b =   1  implicitly-created wire
assign c = b;       // c = 001  <-- bug
my_module i1 (d,e); // d and e are implicitly one-bit wide if not declared.
                    // This could be a bug if the port was intended to be a vector.

Adding `default_nettype none would make the second line of code an error, which makes the bug more visible.
Unpacked vs. Packed Arrays

You may have noticed that in declarations, the vector indices are written before the vector name. This declares the "packed" dimensions of the array, where the bits are "packed" together into a blob (this is relevant in a simulator, but not in hardware). The unpacked dimensions are declared after the name. They are generally used to declare memory arrays. Since ECE253 didn't cover memory arrays, we have not used packed arrays in this course. See http://www.asic-world.com/systemverilog/data_types10.html for more details.

reg [7:0] mem [255:0];   // 256 unpacked elements, each of which is a 8-bit packed vector of reg.
reg mem2 [28:0];         // 29 unpacked elements, each of which is a 1-bit reg.

Accessing Vector Elements: Part-Select

Accessing an entire vector is done using the vector name. For example:

assign w = a;

takes the entire 4-bit vector a and assigns it to the entire 8-bit vector w (declarations are taken from above). If the lengths of the right and left sides don't match, it is zero-extended or truncated as appropriate.

The part-select operator can be used to access a portion of a vector:

w[3:0]      // Only the lower 4 bits of w
x[1]        // The lowest bit of x
x[1:1]      // ...also the lowest bit of x
z[-1:-2]    // Two lowest bits of z
b[3:0]      // Illegal. Vector part-select must match the direction of the declaration.
b[0:3]      // The *upper* 4 bits of b.
assign w[3:0] = b[0:3];    // Assign upper 4 bits of b to lower 4 bits of w. w[3]=b[0], w[2]=b[1], etc.

A Bit of Practice

Build a combinational circuit that splits an input half-word (16 bits, [15:0] ) into lower [7:0] and upper [15:8] bytes.

###########################################################################
Vector2
###########################################################################
A 32-bit vector can be viewed as containing 4 bytes (bits [31:24], [23:16], etc.). Build a circuit that will reverse the byte ordering of the 4-byte word.

AaaaaaaaBbbbbbbbCcccccccDddddddd => DdddddddCcccccccBbbbbbbbAaaaaaaa

This operation is often used when the endianness of a piece of data needs to be swapped, for example between little-endian x86 systems and the big-endian formats used in many Internet protocols.

###########################################################################
Vectorgates
###########################################################################
Build a circuit that has two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of the two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT) of both vectors. Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not (i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.
Bitwise vs. Logical Operators

Earlier, we mentioned that there are bitwise and logical versions of the various boolean operators (e.g., norgate). When using vectors, the distinction between the two operator types becomes important. A bitwise operation between two N-bit vectors replicates the operation for each bit of the vector and produces a N-bit output, while a logical operation treats the entire vector as a boolean value (true = non-zero, false = zero) and produces a 1-bit output.

Look at the simulation waveforms at how the bitwise-OR and logical-OR differ.

###########################################################################
Gates4
###########################################################################
Build a combinational circuit with four inputs, in[3:0].

There are 3 outputs:

    out_and: output of a 4-input AND gate.
    out_or: output of a 4-input OR gate.
    out_xor: output of a 4-input XOR gate.

To review the AND, OR, and XOR operators, see andgate, norgate, and xnorgate.

See also: Even wider gates.

###########################################################################
Vector3
###########################################################################
Part selection was used to select portions of a vector. The concatenation operator {a,b,c} is used to create larger vectors by concatenating smaller portions of a vector together.

{3'b111, 3'b000} => 6'b111000
{1'b1, 1'b0, 3'b101} => 5'b10101
{4'ha, 4'd10} => 8'b10101010     // 4'ha and 4'd10 are both 4'b1010 in binary

Concatenation needs to know the width of every component (or how would you know the length of the result?). Thus, {1, 2, 3} is illegal and results in the error message: unsized constants are not allowed in concatenations.

The concatenation operator can be used on both the left and right sides of assignments.

input [15:0] in;
output [23:0] out;
assign {out[7:0], out[15:8]} = in;         // Swap two bytes. Right side and left side are both 16-bit vectors.
assign out[15:0] = {in[7:0], in[15:8]};    // This is the same thing.
assign out = {in[7:0], in[15:8]};       // This is different. The 16-bit vector on the right is extended to
                                        // match the 24-bit vector on the left, so out[23:16] are zero.
                                        // In the first two examples, out[23:16] are not assigned.

A Bit of Practice

Given several input vectors, concatenate them together then split them up into several output vectors. There are six 5-bit input vectors: a, b, c, d, e, and f, for a total of 30 bits of input. There are four 8-bit output vectors: w, x, y, and z, for 32 bits of output. The output should be a concatenation of the input vectors followed by two 1 bits:

Given an 8-bit input vector [7:0], reverse its bit ordering.

See also: Reversing a longer vector.

##########################################################################
Vector4
##########################################################################
The concatenation operator allowed concatenating together vectors to form a larger vector. But sometimes you want the same thing concatenated together many times, and it is still tedious to do something like assign a = {b,b,b,b,b,b};. The replication operator allows repeating a vector and concatenating them together:

{num{vector}}

This replicates vector by num times. num must be a constant. Both sets of braces are required.

Examples:

{5{1'b1}}           // 5'b11111 (or 5'd31 or 5'h1f)
{2{a,b,c}}          // The same as {a,b,c,a,b,c}
{3'd5, {2{3'd6}}}   // 9'b101_110_110. It's a concatenation of 101 with
                    // the second vector, which is two copies of 3'b110.

A Bit of Practice

One common place to see a replication operator is when sign-extending a smaller number to a larger one, while preserving its signed value. This is done by replicating the sign bit (the most significant bit) of the smaller number to the left. For example, sign-extending 4'b0101 (5) to 8 bits results in 8'b00000101 (5), while sign-extending 4'b1101 (-3) to 8 bits results in 8'b11111101 (-3).

Build a circuit that sign-extends an 8-bit number to 32 bits. This requires a concatenation of 24 copies of the sign bit (i.e., replicate bit[7] 24 times) followed by the 8-bit number itself.

###########################################################################
Vector5
###########################################################################
Given five 1-bit signals (a, b, c, d, and e), compute all 25 pairwise one-bit comparisons in the 25-bit output vector. The output should be 1 if the two bits being compared are equal.

out[24] = ~a ^ a;   // a == a, so out[24] is always 1.
out[23] = ~a ^ b;
out[22] = ~a ^ c;
...
out[ 1] = ~e ^ d;
out[ 0] = ~e ^ e;

Vector5.png

As the diagram shows, this can be done more easily using the replication and concatenation operators.

    The top vector is a concatenation of 5 repeats of each input
    The bottom vector is 5 repeats of a concatenation of the 5 inputs

###########################################################################
Vector5
###########################################################################
By now, you're familiar with a module, which is a circuit that interacts with its outside through input and output ports. Larger, more complex circuits are built by composing bigger modules out of smaller modules and other pieces (such as assign statements and always blocks) connected together. This forms a hierarchy, as modules can contain instances of other modules.

The figure below shows a very simple circuit with a sub-module. In this exercise, create one instance of module mod_a, then connect the module's three pins (in1, in2, and out) to your top-level module's three ports (wires a, b, and out). The module mod_a is provided for you — you must instantiate it.

When connecting modules, only the ports on the module are important. You do not need to know the code inside the module. The code for module mod_a looks like this:
Module moda.png

module mod_a ( input in1, input in2, output out );
    // Module body
endmodule

The hierarchy of modules is created by instantiating one module inside another, as long as all of the modules used belong to the same project (so the compiler knows where to find the module). The code for one module is not written inside another module's body (Code for different modules are not nested).

You may connect signals to the module by port name or port position. For extra practice, try both methods.

#############################################################################
module
#############################################################################
This problem is similar to the previous one (module). You are given a module named mod_a that has 2 outputs and 4 inputs, in that order. You must connect the 6 ports by position to your top-level module's ports out1, out2, a, b, c, and d, in that order.

You are given the following module:

module mod_a ( output, output, input, input, input, input );

############################################################################
Module_pos
############################################################################
This problem is similar to module. You are given a module named mod_a that has 2 outputs and 4 inputs, in some order. You must connect the 6 ports by name to your top-level module's ports:

You are given the following module:

module mod_a ( output out1, output out2, input in1, input in2, input in3, input in4);

############################################################################
Module_name
############################################################################
You are given a module my_dff with two inputs and one output (that implements a D flip-flop). Instantiate three of them, then chain them together to make a shift register of length 3. The clk port needs to be connected to all instances.

The module provided to you is: module my_dff ( input clk, input d, output q );

Note that to make the internal connections, you will need to declare some wires. Be careful about naming your wires and module instances: the names must be unique.

############################################################################
Module_shift
############################################################################
This exercise is an extension of module_shift. Instead of module ports being only single pins, we now have modules with vectors as ports, to which you will attach wire vectors instead of plain wires. Like everywhere else in Verilog, the vector length of the port does not have to match the wire connecting to it, but this will cause zero-padding or trucation of the vector. This exercise does not use connections with mismatched vector lengths.

You are given a module my_dff8 with two inputs and one output (that implements a set of 8 D flip-flops). Instantiate three of them, then chain them together to make a 8-bit wide shift register of length 3. In addition, create a 4-to-1 multiplexer (not provided) that chooses what to output depending on sel[1:0]: The value at the input d, after the first, after the second, or after the third D flip-flop. (Essentially, sel selects how many cycles to delay the input, from zero to three clock cycles.)

The module provided to you is: module my_dff8 ( input clk, input [7:0] d, output [7:0] q );

The multiplexer is not provided. One possible way to write one is inside an always block with a case statement inside.

############################################################################
Module_shift8
############################################################################
You are given a module add16 that performs a 16-bit addition. Instantiate two of them to create a 32-bit adder. One add16 module computes the lower 16 bits of the addition result, while the second add16 module computes the upper 16 bits of the result, after receiving the carry-out from the first adder. Your 32-bit adder does not need to handle carry-in (assume 0) or carry-out (ignored), but the internal modules need to in order to function correctly. (In other words, the add16 module performs 16-bit a + b + cin, while your module performs 32-bit a + b).

Connect the modules together as shown in the diagram below. The provided module add16 has the following declaration:

module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );

############################################################################
module_add
############################################################################
In this exercise, you will create a circuit with two levels of hierarchy. Your top_module will instantiate two copies of add16 (provided), each of which will instantiate 16 copies of add1 (which you must write). Thus, you must write two modules: top_module and add1.

Like module_add, you are given a module add16 that performs a 16-bit addition. You must instantiate two of them to create a 32-bit adder. One add16 module computes the lower 16 bits of the addition result, while the second add16 module computes the upper 16 bits of the result. Your 32-bit adder does not need to handle carry-in (assume 0) or carry-out (ignored).

Connect the add16 modules together as shown in the diagram below. The provided module add16 has the following declaration:

module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );

Within each add16, 16 full adders (module add1, not provided) are instantiated to actually perform the addition. You must write the full adder module that has the following declaration:

module add1 ( input a, input b, input cin, output sum, output cout );

Recall that a full adder computes the sum and carry-out of a+b+cin.

In summary, there are three modules in this design:

    top_module — Your top-level module that contains two of...
    add16, provided — A 16-bit adder module that is composed of 16 of...
    add1 — A 1-bit full adder module.


If your submission is missing a module add1, you will get an error message that says Error (12006): Node instance "user_fadd[0].a1" instantiates undefined entity "add1".

############################################################################
Module_fadd
############################################################################
One drawback of the ripple carry adder (See previous exercise) is that the delay for an adder to compute the carry out (from the carry-in, in the worst case) is fairly slow, and the second-stage adder cannot begin computing its carry-out until the first-stage adder has finished. This makes the adder slow. One improvement is a carry-select adder, shown below. The first-stage adder is the same as before, but we duplicate the second-stage adder, one assuming carry-in=0 and one assuming carry-in=1, then using a fast 2-to-1 multiplexer to select which result happened to be correct.

In this exercise, you are provided with the same module add16 as the previous exercise, which adds two 16-bit numbers with carry-in and produces a carry-out and 16-bit sum. You must instantiate three of these to build the carry-select adder, using your own 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer.

Connect the modules together as shown in the diagram below. The provided module add16 has the following declaration:

module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );

###########################################################################
module_cseladd
###########################################################################
An adder-subtractor can be built from an adder by optionally negating one of the inputs, which is equivalent to inverting the input then adding 1. The net result is a circuit that can do two operations: (a + b + 0) and (a + ~b + 1). See Wikipedia if you want a more detailed explanation of how this circuit works.

Build the adder-subtractor below.

You are provided with a 16-bit adder module, which you need to instantiate twice:

module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );

Use a 32-bit wide XOR gate to invert the b input whenever sub is 1. (This can also be viewed as b[31:0] XORed with sub replicated 32 times. See replication operator.). Also connect the sub input to the carry-in of the adder.
